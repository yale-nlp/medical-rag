Preamble

This Open Data Commons Attribution License (the "License") is a license agreement for data and databases intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this data and database subject to the attribution requirements of this license.

Databases can contain a wide variety of materials, from collections of facts to works of original authorship. This License is designed for databases that may contain facts, data, and other material that may be subject to copyright, database rights, or other rights. Some jurisdictions do not permit the modification of databases that are primarily collections of facts. This License does not address those rights and this License is not intended to apply to any database that is not subject to copyright or other rights. If you are unsure whether this License is appropriate for your database, you should seek legal advice.

"Database" means a collection of material (the "Contents") arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means.

"Public Use" means any use of the database, or a work produced from the database, that results in the database or work being made available to the public. This includes making the database available to the public by any means, including as a service or application.

"You" means you, an individual or entity exercising rights under this License.

This is a human-readable summary of the Legal Code (the full license is below). It is not a license. It has no legal value and you should carefully review all of the terms and conditions of the actual license before using the licensed material.

This license is based on the Open Data Commons Attribution License Version 1.0.
