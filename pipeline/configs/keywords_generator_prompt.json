Follow these rules strictly:\n\n1.  **Focus ONLY on the IMPRESSION section.** Ignore findings mentioned only in the clinical history or indication.\n2.  **Extract the core diagnosis.** REMOVE modifiers like 'mild', 'trace', 'left', 'right', 'apical', 'persistent', 'bilateral', etc.\n3.  **If the IMPRESSION indicates NO significant findings** (e.g., 'No acute abnormality', 'unremarkable'), you MUST return an empty list: `{\"keywords\": []}`. DO NOT extract the negative phrase itself.\n4.  **Output ONLY a valid JSON object** in the format `{\"keywords\": [\"diagnosis1\", \"diagnosis2\"]}`.\n\nHere are examples based on real, expert-annotated data:\n\n---\n\n[EXAMPLE 1: Negative Case]\nUSER: Radiology Report: \"STUDY: XR WRIST RIGHT PA LATERAL AND OBLIQUE INDICATION: Pain, numbness and burning in the right forearm. Scheduled for carpal tunnel surgery today. COMPARISON: RAD WRIST (MIN 3V) <<DATE>>  FINDINGS: No acute fracture or dislocation. The soft tissues are unremarkable. There is no unexpected radiopaque foreign body.   IMPRESSION: No acute osseous injury.  <<HOSPITAL>> Radiology Notify System Classification: Routine.

HISTORY: AKI.   COMPARISON: Abdominal ultrasound <<DATE>>. CT abdomen/pelvis <<DATE>>.  TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging were performed.   FINDINGS:   RIGHT KIDNEY:  Size: 12.4 cm in maximal sagittal dimension.   Echogenicity: Normal.  Hydronephrosis: Not present.  Calculi: A 0.3 cm lower pole and a 0.4 cm mid pole nonobstructing calculi. Focal lesions: None.   LEFT KIDNEY:  Size: 10.4 cm in maximal sagittal dimension.   Echogenicity: Normal.  Hydronephrosis: Not present.  Calculi: A 1.0 cm lower pole nonobstructing calculus.  Focal lesions: None.   URINARY BLADDER:  Volume: Normally distended.  Wall thickness: Normal.  Focal lesions: None.  Ureteral jets: Could not be detected.   Partially imaged diffusely echogenic liver, likely representative steatosis.  IMPRESSION:   Bilateral nephrolithiasis. No hydronephrosis.  Fatty liver changes. If there is a clinical suspicion for underlying liver fibrosis, further evaluation with ultrasound liver elastography can be performed for staging of liver fibrosis.  <<HOSPITAL>> Radiology Notify System Classification: Routine.

Within the pelvis, incompletely evaluated there is a lobulated 6.6 cm focus demonstrating dependent T2 hypointense signal compatible with hemorrhage. ... likely represents a pelvic hematoma. ... IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for epidural hematoma.  No significant spinal canal narrowing of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. 2.
