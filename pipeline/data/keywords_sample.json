IV CONTRAST:  80 ML IOHEXOL (OMNIPAQUE) 350 MG IODINE/ML INJECTION  FINDINGS: LUNG BASES: Unremarkable.  LIVER: Hypodensity along the falciform ligament, favored to represent focal fatty infiltration. The liver again appears mildly enlarged. GALLBLADDER: Surgically absent. SPLEEN: Unremarkable. PANCREAS: Unremarkable. ADRENALS: Unremarkable. KIDNEYS: Unremarkable.  BOWEL: There is persistent inflammatory changes involving the descending/sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula noted, in keeping with acute diverticulitis. There is no evidence of an adjacent abscess. There is no bowel obstruction. A few prominent loops of fluid-filled small bowel is noted. APPENDIX: The appendix is not discretely identified, however there are no inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant to suggest acute appendicitis.  PERITONEUM: No ascites.  LYMPH NODES: There is no abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy. VESSELS: Mild atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and branch vessels.  URINARY BLADDER: Unremarkable. PELVIS: Unremarkable. There are multiple pelvic phleboliths.  BONES & SOFT TISSUE: Multilevel degenerative changes most significant at the L5-S1 interface. No aggressive osseous lesion.  IMPRESSION:  Acute uncomplicated descending colon/sigmoid diverticulitis. Given multiple recurrent episodes of diverticulitis, evaluation with colonoscopy after the acute phase can be considered.  Yale Radiology Notify System Classification: Routine.  Report initiated by:  David Kauffman, MD  Reported and signed by: Tony Lin, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging",

IV CONTRAST:  80 ML IOHEXOL (OMNIPAQUE) 350 MG IODINE/ML INJECTION      FINDINGS: LUNG BASES: A few small cysts are seen in the bilateral lower lobes.      LIVER: There is a too small characterize right hepatic lobe hypodensity. GALLBLADDER: Unremarkable. SPLEEN: Unremarkable. PANCREAS: Unremarkable. ADRENALS: Unremarkable. KIDNEYS: There is heterogeneous enhancement of the right kidney with surrounding stranding/inflammatory change. There are also focal hypodensities throughout the right kidney which could represent phlegmon/developing abscesses. There are punctate nonobstructing right renal calculi. There is no hydronephrosis.

COMPARISON: NONE  TECHNIQUE: CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast.   IV contrast administered:  80 ML IOHEXOL (OMNIPAQUE) 350 MG IODINE/ML INJECTION  Technical limitations: None.  FINDINGS: Please see separately dictated chest CT report for related findings.  There is an ill-defined heterogenous slightly hypoenhancing mass in the right hepatic lobe measuring up to 9.0 x 5.9 x 11.5 cm with multiple surrounding satellite lesions, including a 3.3 cm satellite lesion in segment 4A and a 3.2 cm satellite lesion in segment 2. The hepatic vasculature is patent. No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation. Status post cholecystectomy.  There is a 1.0 cm hypodense lesion along the anterior spleen likely reflecting a splenic cyst vs hemangioma. Splenomegaly measuring up to 16.7 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  There are multiple periportal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For instance, a 2.2 cm periportal lymph node (series 4, image 264).  No large ascites or bowel obstruction.  There are multiple sclerotic osseous metastatic disease throughout the visualized thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies. A representative osseous lesion measures up to 1.3 cm in the right L4 vertebral body (series 4, image 446).  IMPRESSION: Liver mass with innumerous satellite lesions, in keeping with patient's known intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and metastatic lymphadenopathy and osseous disease in the abdomen and pelvis as described.
